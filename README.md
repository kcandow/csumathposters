# CSU Math Posters
A collection of math formula posters roughly aligned with Cleveland State's math curriculum

This project started in 2014 at the Math Learning Center as a way to help students see
the breath of content across a course and to use as a quick-reference sheet for homework help.

## Contributing

This project has been dormant since 2014, so there likely errors in content and drifts
in course curriculum that reduce the usefulness of these posters.

For changes, submit a Pull Request and include a summary of the scope of the change. Check
that modern Microsoft Word can generate a reasonable "Track Changes" between `main` and
the new branch.

For issues or suggestions, submit an Issue with a detailed description of the area of improvement.
